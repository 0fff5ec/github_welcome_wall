Hello and welcome to GitHub! 

You're on here! You did it! Now contribute to your very first open source project by writing a quick message here to welcome anyone else who's new here. 

The only rule here is: please be kind! The only messages that won't be accepted are ones that are anything other than welcoming and encouraging. You have the rest of the internet at your disposal for that stuff.

If you're an overthinker like I am, go ahead and add something like 


"Welcome to GitHub! You made it! 

Now get out there and change the world"


I can't wait to see what you guys come up with!
